# Transformer-XH

We use the [code](https://github.com/microsoft/Transformer-XH/) provided by the [original paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1eIiCNYwS) authors.

In our experiments, we use `bert-base-cased` instead of `bert-base-uncased`. We use the same set of hyperparameters as the original work. We replace the default BERT encoder with our RuleTaker pretrained encoder.
